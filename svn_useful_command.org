* How to view changes made to files on a certain revision
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
svn diff -c <revision> path/to/repo
#+END_SRC

The =-c= indicates that you would like to look at a change set, but there
are many othter ways you can look at diffs and changesets.

For example, if you would like to know which files were changed (but not how),
you can issue

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
svn log -v -r <revision>
#+END_SRC

here =-r= is revision, =-v= is verbose, so that which file is changed 
can be seen, without =-v= only commit message can be seen.

Or, if you would like to show at the changes between two revisions (and not just for one commit)
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
svn diff -r <revA>:<revB> path/to/repo
#+END_SRC
